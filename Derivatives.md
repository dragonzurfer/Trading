A **derivative** is a [contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract "Contract") that _derives_ its value from the performance of an underlying entity. This underlying entity can be an [asset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset "Asset"), [index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_fund "Index fund"), or [interest rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate "Interest rate"), and is often simply called the "underlying". Derivatives can be used for a number of purposes, including [insuring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insuring "Insuring") against price movements ([hedging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_(finance)#Etymology "Hedge (finance)")), increasing exposure to price movements for [speculation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculation "Speculation"), or getting access to otherwise hard-to-trade assets or markets.
