A European option is a version of an [options contract](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/optionscontract.asp) that limits execution to its expiration date. In other words, if the underlying security such as a stock has moved in price, an investor would not be able to exercise the option early and take delivery of or sell the shares. Instead, the call or put action will only take place on the date of option [maturity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maturity.asp).
