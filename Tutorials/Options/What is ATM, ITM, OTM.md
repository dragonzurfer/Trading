Hello and welcome to this short tutorial on ATM, ITM and OTM options with an example of NIFTY. In this tutorial, you will learn what these terms mean and how they affect your option trading.

ATM stands for At The Money, ITM stands for In The Money and OTM stands for Out Of The Money. These are classifications of option contracts based on their strike price and the spot price of the underlying asset.

The strike price is the price at which you can buy or sell the underlying asset if you exercise your option contract. The spot price is the current market price of the underlying asset.

An option contract is said to be ATM if its strike price is approximately equal to the spot price of the underlying asset. [For example, if NIFTY is trading at 8300 in the spot market, then a NIFTY FEB 8300 CALL or PUT option would be an ATM option](https://www.5paisa.com/blog/difference-between-in-the-money-itm-at-the-money-atm-and-out-the-money-otm-call-put-options)[1](https://www.5paisa.com/blog/difference-between-in-the-money-itm-at-the-money-atm-and-out-the-money-otm-call-put-options).

An option contract is said to be ITM if its strike price is favorable compared to the spot price of the underlying asset. [For example, if NIFTY is trading at 8300 in the spot market, then a NIFTY FEB 8200 CALL or a NIFTY FEB 8400 PUT option would be an ITM option](https://www.5paisa.com/blog/difference-between-in-the-money-itm-at-the-money-atm-and-out-the-money-otm-call-put-options)[1](https://www.5paisa.com/blog/difference-between-in-the-money-itm-at-the-money-atm-and-out-the-money-otm-call-put-options). An ITM call option has a strike price lower than the spot price, while an ITM put option has a strike price higher than the spot price.

An option contract is said to be OTM if its strike price is unfavorable compared to the spot price of the underlying asset. [For example, if NIFTY is trading at 8300 in the spot market, then a NIFTY FEB 8400 CALL or a NIFTY FEB 8200 PUT option would be an OTM option](https://www.5paisa.com/blog/difference-between-in-the-money-itm-at-the-money-atm-and-out-the-money-otm-call-put-options)[1](https://www.5paisa.com/blog/difference-between-in-the-money-itm-at-the-money-atm-and-out-the-money-otm-call-put-options). An OTM call option has a strike price higher than the spot price, while an OTM put option has a strike price lower than the spot price.

The moneyness of an option contract affects its intrinsic value and its delta. The intrinsic value is the amount that you would make by exercising your option contract right now. [The delta is the rate of change of your option’s value with respect to changes in the underlying asset’s price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outofthemoney.asp)[2](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outofthemoney.asp).

[An ATM option has zero intrinsic value and a delta close to 0.50](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outofthemoney.asp)[2](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outofthemoney.asp). This means that it has no immediate profit or loss potential and it moves roughly half as much as the underlying asset.

[An ITM option has positive intrinsic value and a delta greater than 0.50](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outofthemoney.asp)[2](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outofthemoney.asp). This means that it has some immediate profit potential and it moves more than half as much as the underlying asset.

[An OTM option has zero intrinsic value and a delta less than 0.50](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outofthemoney.asp)[2](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outofthemoney.asp). This means that it has no immediate profit or loss potential and it moves less than half as much as the underlying asset.

As an example, let’s look at some hypothetical prices for NIFTY FEB options when NIFTY is trading at 8300 in the spot market:

![[Pasted image 20230308230447.png]]

The highlighted row shows ATM options with zero intrinsic value and deltas close to 0.50. The rows above show ITM call options and OTM put options with positive intrinsic values and deltas greater than 0.50. The rows below show OTM call options and ITM put options with positive intrinsic values and deltas greater than 0.50.

As you can see, ITM options are more expensive than ATM options which are more expensive than OTM options. This reflects their different probabilities of expiring in profit.

To practice this concept daily for five minutes, you can do this simple exercise:

1.  Pick any stock index or commodity that you are interested in (such as Nifty, Sensex, Gold etc.)
2.  Look up its current spot price online (such as on Google Finance)
3.  Look up its current monthly expiry options chain online (such as on NSE India)
4.  Identify one ATM call and one ATM put option based on their strike prices
5.  Identify one ITM call and one ITM put option based on their strike prices
6.  Identify one OTM call and one OTM put option based on their strike prices
7.  Compare the prices of these six options and note their intrinsic values and deltas
8.  Repeat this exercise with different spot prices and different expiry dates

This exercise will help you get familiar with the moneyness of option contracts and how they affect their values.
