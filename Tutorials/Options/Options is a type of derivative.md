Hello everyone and welcome to this video where we will learn about derivatives. [[Derivatives]] are financial instruments that derive their value from an underlying asset or [[Index]]. They are used for various purposes such as hedging, speculation, arbitrage and risk management.

In this video, we will cover the following topics:

-   What is an underlying asset or index?
-   What are the types of derivatives?
-   What are the benefits and risks of derivatives?

Let’s start with the first topic: what is an underlying asset or index?

An underlying asset or index is something that has a market value and can be traded. For example, stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities, interest rates and market indices are all underlying assets or indices.

Anything that has a price can have a derivative contract.

A derivative is a contract that has a value that depends on the price or performance of an underlying asset or index. For example, if you buy a derivative contract that pays you 100 rupees if the price of gold goes above 50,000 rupees per 10 grams by next month, then your derivative contract’s value depends on the price of gold.

The price or performance of an underlying asset or index can change due to various factors such as supply and demand, economic conditions, political events and natural disasters. These factors can create uncertainty and volatility in the market.

Now let’s move on to the second topic: what are the types of derivatives?

There are many types of derivatives but they can be broadly classified into four categories: futures, forwards, swaps and options.

Futures are contracts that oblige the buyer and seller to exchange an asset at a predetermined price and date in the future. For example, if you buy a futures contract of Reliance at 2,000 today for delivery on March 31st 2023, you are agreeing to pay 2,000 rupees for one unit of Reliance index on that date, regardless of its market price then.

Options are contracts that give the buyer the right but not the obligation to buy or sell an asset at a specified price and date in the future. 

Swaps and forwards nobody trades

These four types of derivatives have different features and functions but they all share some common characteristics:

-   They involve two parties: one who takes a long position (buyer)

and one who takes a short position (seller).

-   They have a notional value: the amount of the underlying asset or index that the contract is based on.
-   They have a maturity date: the date when the contract expires or is settled.
-   They have a settlement method: how the contract is settled at maturity. It can be [[physical delivery]] (the exchange of the underlying asset) or[[ cash settlement]] (the payment of the difference between the contract price and the market price).

Now let’s move on to the third topic: what are some examples of derivatives?

There are many examples of derivatives in different markets and sectors. Here are some of them:

-   Stock futures and options: these are derivatives that are based on stocks or stock indices. They allow investors to hedge their exposure to stock price movements, speculate on future stock prices, arbitrage between different markets and enhance their leverage.
    
-   Currency futures and options: these are derivatives that are based on currencies or currency pairs. They allow investors to hedge their exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, speculate on future exchange rates, arbitrage between different markets and enhance their leverage.
    
-   Commodity futures and options: these are derivatives that are based on commodities such as gold, oil, wheat, etc. They allow investors to hedge their exposure to commodity price movements, speculate on future commodity prices, arbitrage between different markets and enhance their leverage.
    
-   Interest rate futures and options: these are derivatives that are based on interest rates or interest rate instruments such as bonds, treasury bills, etc. They allow investors to hedge their exposure to interest rate changes, speculate on future interest rates, arbitrage between different markets and enhance their leverage.
    
-   Credit derivatives: these are derivatives that are based on credit risk or credit events such as default, downgrade, etc. They allow investors to hedge their exposure to credit risk, speculate on future credit events, arbitrage between different markets and enhance their leverage.
    

These are just some of the examples of derivatives that exist in the financial world. There are many more types and variations of derivatives that cater to different needs and preferences of investors.

Now let’s move on to the final topic: what are the benefits and risks of derivatives?

Derivatives have many benefits for investors such as:

-   Hedging: Derivatives can help investors reduce their exposure to these uncertainties and volatilities by allowing them to lock in a price or rate for an asset or index in advance. This is called hedging.
    
-   Speculation: derivatives can help investors profit from price movements in an asset or index without actually owning it. This can increase their returns and diversify their portfolio.
    
-   Arbitrage: derivatives can help investors exploit price differences between similar assets or indices across different markets or time periods. This can generate risk-free profits.
    
-   Leverage: derivatives can help investors increase their exposure to an asset or index with a small initial investment. This can magnify their gains but also losses.
    

However, derivatives also have many risks for investors such as:

-   Market risk: derivatives can expose investors to market risk which is the risk of losing money due to unfavorable price movements in an asset or index. Market risk can be affected by various factors such as supply and demand, economic conditions, political events and natural disasters.
    
-   Counterparty risk: derivatives can expose investors to counterparty risk which is the risk of losing money due to default or failure of the other party in a derivative contract. Counterparty risk can be affected by various factors such as creditworthiness, liquidity and reputation of the other party.
    
-   Liquidity risk: derivatives can expose investors to liquidity risk which is the risk of not being able to buy or sell a derivative contract at a fair price due to lack of buyers or sellers in the market. Liquidity risk can be affected by various factors such as trading volume, market depth and transparency.
    

-   Operational risk: derivatives can expose investors to operational risk which is the risk of losing money due to errors, fraud, system failures or legal issues in the execution or settlement of a derivative contract. Operational risk can be affected by various factors such as human error, technology failure and regulatory compliance.
    
-   Leverage risk: derivatives can expose investors to leverage risk which is the risk of losing more money than their initial investment due to the use of borrowed funds or margin in a derivative contract. Leverage risk can be affected by various factors such as margin requirements, interest rates and volatility.
    

These are some of the benefits and risks of derivatives that investors should be aware of before entering into a derivative contract. Derivatives can be powerful tools for enhancing returns and managing risks but they also require careful analysis and understanding of their features and functions.
