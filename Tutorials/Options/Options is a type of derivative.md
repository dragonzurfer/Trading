#### why options are cool
Options are a type of derivative that give you the power to buy or sell an underlying asset at a fixed price in the future. Options are amazing because they let you profit from different market scenarios without owning the asset itself. You can use options to hedge your risk, speculate on price movements, generate income, and create complex strategies.

Options are flexible and versatile instruments that can suit any trading style and goal. You can choose from different types of options, such as calls and puts, American and European, vanilla and exotic. You can also customize the strike price, expiration date, and contract size of your options to fit your needs and expectations.

Options are exciting because they have leverage effect. This means that you can control a large amount of value with a small amount of money. For example, if you buy one call option on Apple stock with a strike price of $150 and an expiration date of March 31st for $5 per share, you only need to pay $500 ($5 x 100 shares) to have the right to buy 100 shares of Apple for $150 each until March 31st. If Apple stock rises to $200 by then, you can exercise your option and buy 100 shares for $15,000 ($150 x 100), then sell them for $20,000 ($200 x 100), making a profit of $4,500 ($20,000 - $15,000 - $500). That's a return of 900% on your initial investment!

Options are fun because they challenge your analytical skills and creativity. You need to understand how various factors affect the price of an option, such as the underlying asset price, volatility, time decay, interest rate, dividend yield etc. You also need to devise strategies that match your outlook and risk tolerance. For example,
- If you are bullish on an asset (expecting it to rise), you can buy call options or sell put options.
- If you are bearish on an asset (expecting it to fall), you can buy put options or sell call options.
- If you are neutral on an asset (expecting it to stay stable), you can sell straddles or strangles (a combination of call and put options with different strike prices).
- If you expect high volatility in an asset (large price fluctuations), you can buy straddles or strangles.
- If you expect low volatility in an asset (small price movements), you can sell iron condors or butterflies (a combination of four options with different strike prices).

Options are awesome because they offer unlimited potential rewards with limited risks. When you buy an option,
you only risk losing the premium that you paid for it,
but when it goes in your favor,
you can make unlimited profits depending on how much the underlying asset moves.
When you sell an option,
you receive the premium upfront,
but when it goes against you,
you may face unlimited losses depending on how much the underlying asset moves.

Hello everyone and welcome to this video where we will learn about derivatives. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive their value from an underlying asset or [[Index]]. They are used for various purposes such as hedging, speculation, arbitrage and risk management.

In this video, we will cover the following topics:

-   What is an underlying asset or index?
-   What are the types of derivatives?
-   What are some examples of derivatives?
-   What are the benefits and risks of derivatives?

Let’s start with the first topic: what is an underlying asset or index?

An underlying asset or index is something that has a market value and can be traded. For example, stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities, interest rates and market indices are all underlying assets or indices.

A derivative is a contract that has a value that depends on the price or performance of an underlying asset or index. For example, if you buy a derivative contract that pays you 100 rupees if the price of gold goes above 50,000 rupees per 10 grams by next month, then your derivative contract’s value depends on the price of gold.

The price or performance of an underlying asset or index can change due to various factors such as supply and demand, economic conditions, political events and natural disasters. These factors can create uncertainty and volatility in the market.

Derivatives can help investors reduce their exposure to these uncertainties and volatilities by allowing them to lock in a price or rate for an asset or index in advance. This is called hedging.

Derivatives can also help investors profit from these uncertainties and volatilities by allowing them to bet on the future direction of an asset or index without actually owning it. This is called speculation.

Derivatives can also help investors exploit differences between prices or rates of similar assets or indices across different markets or time periods. This is called arbitrage.

Derivatives can also help investors manage their risk by diversifying their portfolio and increasing their leverage.

Now let’s move on to the second topic: what are the types of derivatives?

There are many types of derivatives but they can be broadly classified into four categories: futures, forwards, swaps and options.

Futures are contracts that oblige the buyer and seller to exchange an asset at a predetermined price and date in the future. For example, if you buy a futures contract of Nifty 50 index at 17,000 today for delivery on March 31st 2023, you are agreeing to pay 17,000 rupees for one unit of Nifty 50 index on that date, regardless of its market price then.

Forwards are contracts that oblige the buyer and seller to exchange an asset at a predetermined price and date in the future but they do not trade on an exchange. They are customized agreements between two parties that suit their specific needs. For example, if you want to buy US dollars at 75 rupees per dollar on June 30th 2023, you can enter into a forward contract with a bank that agrees to sell you US dollars at that rate on that date.

Swaps are contracts that oblige the parties to exchange periodic payments based on different rates or prices of an underlying asset or index. For example, if you have a loan with a fixed interest rate but you want to switch to a floating interest rate, you can enter into a swap contract with another party that has a loan with a floating interest rate but wants to switch to a fixed interest rate. You agree to pay each other the difference between your respective interest rates on your loans periodically.

Options are contracts that give the buyer the right but not the obligation to buy or sell an asset at a specified price and date in the future. For example, if you buy a call option of Reliance Industries Ltd. at 2, 000 today for expiry on March 31st 2023, you have the right to buy one share of Reliance Industries Ltd. at 2, 000 rupees on that date, if its market price is higher than 2, 000 rupees then. If its market price is lower than 2, 000 rupees then, you can choose not to exercise your option and let it expire worthless.

These four types of derivatives have different features and functions but they all share some common characteristics:

-   They involve two parties: one who takes a long position (buyer)

and one who takes a short position (seller).

-   They have a notional value: the amount of the underlying asset or index that the contract is based on.
-   They have a maturity date: the date when the contract expires or is settled.
-   They have a settlement method: how the contract is settled at maturity. It can be physical delivery (the exchange of the underlying asset) or cash settlement (the payment of the difference between the contract price and the market price).

Now let’s move on to the third topic: what are some examples of derivatives?

There are many examples of derivatives in different markets and sectors. Here are some of them:

-   Stock futures and options: these are derivatives that are based on stocks or stock indices. They allow investors to hedge their exposure to stock price movements, speculate on future stock prices, arbitrage between different markets and enhance their leverage.
    
-   Currency futures and options: these are derivatives that are based on currencies or currency pairs. They allow investors to hedge their exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, speculate on future exchange rates, arbitrage between different markets and enhance their leverage.
    
-   Commodity futures and options: these are derivatives that are based on commodities such as gold, oil, wheat, etc. They allow investors to hedge their exposure to commodity price movements, speculate on future commodity prices, arbitrage between different markets and enhance their leverage.
    
-   Interest rate futures and options: these are derivatives that are based on interest rates or interest rate instruments such as bonds, treasury bills, etc. They allow investors to hedge their exposure to interest rate changes, speculate on future interest rates, arbitrage between different markets and enhance their leverage.
    
-   Credit derivatives: these are derivatives that are based on credit risk or credit events such as default, downgrade, etc. They allow investors to hedge their exposure to credit risk, speculate on future credit events, arbitrage between different markets and enhance their leverage.
    

These are just some of the examples of derivatives that exist in the financial world. There are many more types and variations of derivatives that cater to different needs and preferences of investors.

Now let’s move on to the final topic: what are the benefits and risks of derivatives?

Derivatives have many benefits for investors such as:

-   Hedging: derivatives can help investors reduce their risk by locking in a price or rate for an asset or index in advance. This can protect them from adverse price movements in the future.
    
-   Speculation: derivatives can help investors profit from price movements in an asset or index without actually owning it. This can increase their returns and diversify their portfolio.
    
-   Arbitrage: derivatives can help investors exploit price differences between similar assets or indices across different markets or time periods. This can generate risk-free profits.
    
-   Leverage: derivatives can help investors increase their exposure to an asset or index with a small initial investment. This can magnify their gains but also losses.
    

However, derivatives also have many risks for investors such as:

-   Market risk: derivatives can expose investors to market risk which is the risk of losing money due to unfavorable price movements in an asset or index. Market risk can be affected by various factors such as supply and demand, economic conditions, political events and natural disasters.
    
-   Counterparty risk: derivatives can expose investors to counterparty risk which is the risk of losing money due to default or failure of the other party in a derivative contract. Counterparty risk can be affected by various factors such as creditworthiness, liquidity and reputation of the other party.
    
-   Liquidity risk: derivatives can expose investors to liquidity risk which is the risk of not being able to buy or sell a derivative contract at a fair price due to lack of buyers or sellers in the market. Liquidity risk can be affected by various factors such as trading volume, market depth and transparency.
    

-   Operational risk: derivatives can expose investors to operational risk which is the risk of losing money due to errors, fraud, system failures or legal issues in the execution or settlement of a derivative contract. Operational risk can be affected by various factors such as human error, technology failure and regulatory compliance.
    
-   Leverage risk: derivatives can expose investors to leverage risk which is the risk of losing more money than their initial investment due to the use of borrowed funds or margin in a derivative contract. Leverage risk can be affected by various factors such as margin requirements, interest rates and volatility.
    

These are some of the benefits and risks of derivatives that investors should be aware of before entering into a derivative contract. Derivatives can be powerful tools for enhancing returns and managing risks but they also require careful analysis and understanding of their features and functions.

This concludes our video on derivatives. We hope you learned something new and useful today. Thank you for watching and see you next time!
