Some may know more and some less. But it's ok, because this series is an attempt to teach people how to get into trading from scratch.

Trading is the buying and selling of securities, such as stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities, as opposed to investing, which suggests a buy-and-hold strategy. Anything and everything which can be bought or sold can be traded. 

In India we have two exchanges that facilitates this. The [[(National Stock Exchange]] and Bombay stock exchange. To start trading in these exchanges you need to create an account with a broker.

## What is a broker?
A broker acts as an intermediary between its clients and the exchanges where these financial instruments are traded. Brokers offers a platform for its clients to access the exchanges, execute trades, and manage their investments. Broker earns a commission on the trades executed by its clients on its platform. You ideally want to pick a broker who offers low brokerage fees, high-speed execution, and user-friendly platforms to its clients, making it easier for retail investors to participate in the stock market.

Broadly Trading can be classified as a short term when you compare it with investing. Since investing periods range from months to years.

We can further classify trading into mainly two types
- Intra-Day
- Positional
Intraday trades are those which one enters and exits on the same day. Positional trades are ones that you carry over to the next day or multiple days.

We can further classify trading into two types
- Systematic Trading
- Discretionary Trading

Systematic Trading
-  In this style of trading we develop a strategy based on historical evidence. We define a set of rules for entry and exit and act upon these rules as signals.
- Usually this type of trading is automated since the rules don't change. However, sometimes if the rules are too complex then they are done manually as well.
- Popularly this form of trading is known as algo-trading.

Discretionary Trading
- Discretionary like the name suggests are trades that are taken based on ones own judgement.
- Discretionary traders collect various data points and make an analysis.
- In Discretionary trading, traders rely on their experience, expertise, and analysis of market trends and conditions to make trading decisions.
